What Is A CMA?
The biggest mistake home sellers make is overpricing their home. A Comparative Market Analysis or CMA is used to help decide the best price to list your home for.
____________________________________________________________ What is a CMA?
A CMA is a comparison of the most recent ​Active​, ​Sold​ and ​Pending​ properties in the same neighborhood. These homes are commonly referred to as ​Listings​. Each listing is detailed with information like ​square feet, bedrooms, bathrooms​ and ​lot size​ to name a few. Your Realtor will use this information to determine the Market Value and most accurate listing price for your home.
Where does the data come from?
The information used in your CMA is provided by your local Multiple Listing Service or MLS. MLS data is private and can only be accessed by licensed members who pay an annual dues. Brokers, Realtors and Appraisers all used this protected data to arrive at the most accurate listing price.
How Accurate is a CMA?
MLS data is live and the most accurate data that can be used. Listings are entered and updates are realtime. There is ​No Way​ to get more accurate data for your home. That's why it's so important to have a Realtor in your corner during one of the most important transactions in your life. The market is constantly changing because houses are bought and sold everyday. Your Realtor will have their finger on the Markets pulse the entire time.......Real Time.
